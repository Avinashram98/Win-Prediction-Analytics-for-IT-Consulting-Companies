# Win-Prediction-Analytics-for-IT-Consulting-Companies
Description of Dataset

Name: Win Prediction Analytics

Description: 

In this project, we will analyze and predict the win possibilities of deals/projects for an IT consulting company and see how the possibility of winning a deal is impacted by other variables. This will enable the IT consulting company to manage the effort required to win a deal to meet the growth targets. IT firms compete for winning large deals by designing and proposing solutions to their clients. These deals often differ from each other in terms of the sector of the client, solution to be delivered, technology to be used and the scope of the project. The deal value can reach up to millions of dollars, which leads to highly competitive bidding processes. Even a marginal improvement in the win rate can result in substantial revenue addition for IT firms. By predicting the probability of winning a deal, the engagement teams can prioritize the pipeline of opportunities to staff the most attractive options first. With the probability of winning known in advance, deal engagement managers can ensure that for the most profitable deals there are resources available

Motivation:

The primary motivation for working with this dataset was the intrinsic form of the dataset. As the dataset contains a combination of numeric as well as Text, it opens up multiple avenues to test the dataset through various methods. Prediction analysis based on this dataset can significantly boost up the planning phase of the said IT firm. A coherent analysis of the dataset would enable the top brass of the firm to go ahead with their plans for the following year. Moreover, it would also smoothen resource allocation for each prospective bid. This would be of immense importance when it comes to assigning a manager for a particular bid. On the basis of past data and its output a statistically driven decision can be made in various permutations. Similarly, the analysis can also reveal significant insights to ascertain the factors which are eventually causing the firm to lose a bid. 

Objectives:

The proposed investigation seeks to answer the following questions as objectives.
1.	Given a dataset that can characterize the attributes and outcomes of bids, it is desirable to construct a model to predict whether or not a proposed bid will win the deal. Since the outcome is binary (win or loss), a classification model would be best suited for this application. Thus, the primary question in this investigation asks what is the best classification model that can be constructed from the available data?

2.	By creating a classification model, the most influential attributes governing the outcome of a bid can be identified. This poses a follow-up question asking what are the key attributes (corresponding to either the primary or secondary nodes of a classification model) from the dataset?

3.	One interesting attribute of the dataset is the bid manager responsible for each bid. More successful managers bring in more revenue for their company by winning more deals with competitive bids. While the metrics on their relative performances may be routinely checked, it would be interesting to see how the bid managers are ranked by the classification model. Specifically, if a ranking does exist then who are the top 5 bid-managers?

4.	Not all proposals have the same worth or the same invested effort; therefore, how should false predictions in the model be graded? This may require separate consideration for false positives and false negatives. In the case of false negatives, a measure of missed potential revenue could be used (e.g., opportunity cost). On the other hand, false positives could be graded in terms of wasted time and effort. With such a grading system, it would be possible to quantify how costly a specific false prediction could be for a company. This could be evaluated as economic cost or some other, more general idea of cost.

5.	The accuracy of the model will depend on the relative frequency of correct predictions. Thus, as a co-requisite to the creation and training of this model it will be tested as well. The test results will be used to determine the model accuracy. That is, what is the average frequency and severity of false positives?

Outlook

Using data on IT company project bids a classification model can be created to predict the outcome (win/loss) of a given bid. Such a model would primarily help IT companies to decide whether or not to submit a bid for review. Based on the classification model nodes, any information that is not used (i.e., not important information) can be assessed in decisions where company efficiency is involved. Less importance can be given to objects that do not yield critical information, which may result in their total elimination to reduce wasted company resources. In this way, attention and effort (i.e., invested resources) are placed only on worthwhile actions. In the event that the model does not prove to be especially useful this in itself provides insight for companies seeking to create predictive models. Such an outcome can inform companies whether to pursue different models (e.g., regression) or whether to invest resources in predictive modeling altogether.
