# Win-Prediction-Analytics-for-IT-Consulting-Companies
Description of Dataset

Name: Win Prediction Analytics

Description: 

In this project, we will analyze and predict the win possibilities of deals/projects for an IT consulting company and see how the possibility of winning a deal is impacted by other variables. This will enable the IT consulting company to manage the effort required to win a deal to meet the growth targets. IT firms compete for winning large deals by designing and proposing solutions to their clients. These deals often differ from each other in terms of the sector of the client, solution to be delivered, technology to be used and the scope of the project. The deal value can reach up to millions of dollars, which leads to highly competitive bidding processes. Even a marginal improvement in the win rate can result in substantial revenue addition for IT firms. By predicting the probability of winning a deal, the engagement teams can prioritize the pipeline of opportunities to staff the most attractive options first. With the probability of winning known in advance, deal engagement managers can ensure that for the most profitable deals there are resources available
